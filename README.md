Nemea
=====
A First-In-First-Out Waiting Queue
----------------------------------

Is your server code unoptimized? Can it not handle more than a single request at the same time? Are users cursing at you while their simple HTTP requests are taking forever to resolve? Is Electronic Arts your role model for their amazing server structure in SimCity? Did you absolutely love the hours long waiting queues in Diablo 3?

*Do you just wish you had less users to deal with?*

Well, don't worry. Nemea is here for you! In this simple server, we adapt the knowledge of the elder bureaucrats to the fast growing worldwide web. Wireless bureaucracy: The future of the past is now.

Our Amazing Features
--------------------
### Reducing Server Loads

Back in the good old days, we had bureaucracy. To get the service of public servants, the public would have to form queues and have to deal with tons of government-approved papers. All of this to get just a single request done! However, the times have changed. Normally in web services, users get their requests resolve wherever they want, whenever they want. We can not do anything about wherever here (not that we aren't trying), but with Nemea you can do something about *whenever*.

With our server, you will be able to tell your users to *get in the line* if they want to use your services. Assuming you're using horribly unoptimized server software which can not handle two or three simultaneous requests, **this reduces the average request time from exponential time to linear time**.

### A Sense of Justice

If you have ever been in Italy, you should know how chaotic queues get. If Italian queues are an apt analogy for more than a couple users trying to use your webservice, you need Nemea. Without us, the request order becomes totally random; with some new users completing their requests in ten seconds while some users have been waiting for hours. This hurts the users' beliefs in your competence (if they had any in the first place). But with Nemea, **the Italian queues turn into German queues**. One simple initialization and you get perfect web bureaucracy.
